# WHAT THIS REPO IS
## INTRODUCTION
I'm new to the world of Love2D and Lua. I've been learning the the framework and
the language itself for sometime now and it's been a blast. Lua is such a fun
language to learn.

One problem I tend to overlook most of the time while developing in a framework
is that, most of my files aren't organized - they're all over the place - so I
decided to make a 'boilerplate' of some sort so I could just clone and start
working on new projects.

This format is heavily based on headchant's boilerplate and most of the credits
go to him.

_NOTE: This is for Love2D 0.9.2. I am not sure if it works with other versions._

## INSTALLATION
Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/mavz42/Love2D-OOP-Test.git
```

Go into the folder and run the test game:
```
love game.love
```

## LIBRARIES
The custom libs packaged in this framework are included with these things in
mind:

- Simplicity
- Cleanliness
- Newbie friendly

These are the Libraries included:

* [Bump](https://github.com/kikito/bump.lua) - A cool and easy to use collision
detection library.
* [Gamera](https://github.com//kikito/gamera) - A camera for LOVE.
* [MiddleClass](https://github.com/kikito/middleclass) - A simple OOP for Lua.
* [Tween](https://github.com/kikito/tween.lua) - A small library to perform
