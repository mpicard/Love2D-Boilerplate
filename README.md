# WHAT THIS REPO IS
I'm new to the world of Love2D and Lua. I've been learning the the framework and
the language itself for sometime now and it's been a blast. Lua is such a fun
language to learn.

One problem I tend to overlook most of the time while developing in a framework
is that, most of my files aren't organized - they're all over the place - so I
decided to make a 'boilerplate' of some sort so I could just clone and start
working on new projects.

This format is heavily based on headchant's boilerplate and most of the credits
go to him.

NOTE: This is for Love2D 0.9.2. I am not sure if it works with other versions.
